                        <b><i>HTML5</i></b> is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 
                        It is the fifth and final major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank"><b>HTML</b></a>
                        version that is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank"> World Wide Web</a> Consortium (W3C) 
                        recommendation. The current specification is known as the  
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Living_Standard" target="_blank">HTML Living Standard.</a> It is 
                        maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium 
                        of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).

                        <b><i>HTML5</i></b> was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and 
                        <b>"W3C Recommendation"</b> status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support 
                        for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by 
                        humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., 
                        without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended 
                        to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

                        The W3C proposed a greater reliance on modularity as a key part of the plan to make faster progress, meaning identifying specific features, 
                        either proposed or already existing in the spec, and advancing them as separate specifications. Some technologies that were originally defined 
                        in HTML 5 itself are now defined in separate specifications:

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, 
            HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments on 
            XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) workshop in 
            June 2004, focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing browsers, including an initial 
            draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML.
            Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web 
            Applications 1.0, was also announced. The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5. The HTML5 specification 
            was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.
