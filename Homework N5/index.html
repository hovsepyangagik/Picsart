        <h2>What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?</h2>
        <p><mark>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes  <br> 
            inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web <br> 
            browsers how to display a web page's words and images.</mark> </p>

        <p>Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is <br>
            referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements <br> 
            come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p>

                <li style="color: red;">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web.</li>
                <li>HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link.</li>
                <li>Early versions of HTML were static (Web 1.0), while newer iterations feature a great deal of dynamic flexibility (Web 2.0, 3.0).</li>
                <li>Markup is the text that appears between two pointed brackets (e.g., <footnote>), and content is everything else.</li>

        <h2>HTML Explained</h2>
        <p>HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website <br>
        creation. The language, which has code words and syntax just like any other <br> 
        language, is relatively easy to comprehend and, as time goes on, increasingly <br> 
        powerful in what it allows someone to create. HTML continues to evolve to <br>
        meet the demands and requirements of the Internet under the guise of the <br>
        World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that designs and maintains <br> 
        the language; for instance, with the transition to <a href="#">Web 2.0.</a> </p>

        <p>HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking <br> 
        on special text called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of <br> 
        hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by <br> 
        clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside of <br> 
        them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in <br> 
        the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.</p>

        <h2>HyperText Markup Language Basics</h2>
        <p>At its core, HTML is a series of short codes typed into a text-file. These are the tags <br>
            that power HTML’s capabilities. The text is saved as an HTML file and viewed through a <br>
            web browser. The browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, as <br>
            directed by the codes the author used to write what becomes the visible rendering. <br>
            Writing HTML requires tags to be used correctly to create the author’s vision.</p>

        <p>The tags are what separate normal text from HTML code. Tags are the words between what are <br>
            known as angle-brackets, which allow graphics, images, and tables to appear on the webpage. <br>
            Different tags perform different functions. The most basic tags apply formatting to text. <br>
            As web interfaces need to become more dynamic, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript <br>
            applications may be used. CSS makes web pages more accessible and JavaScript adds power to <br>
            basic HTML.</p>
